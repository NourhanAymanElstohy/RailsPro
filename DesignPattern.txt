Design Pattern used in Project : MVC
Model Control View
We choose this design pattern for our project as it gives the best results , where we create a model 
for the each part or page in the project and to this model we add a view to show the page 
and it's functionalities and the controller holds the functionalities that appear in the view
which provides the website the result needed with optimal solution provided.

Each page in the project has it's own model and each model is associated with a view and 
controller.

This design pattern has solved the problem of code complexity and made it much easier to trace
the issues that rise during implementation of the code.Also it is much more flexible to add or
delete from the code and it resolves the problem of bulk code.

Also this design pattern greatly helps with code reusing as when the code is divided it becomes
easier to use certain functionalities.
