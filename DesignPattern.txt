Design Pattern used in Project : MVC
Model Control View
We choose this design pattern for our project as it gives the best results , where we create a model 
for the each part or page in the project and to this model we add a view to show the page 
and it's functionalities and the controller holds the functionalities that appear in the view
which provides the website the result needed with optimal solution provided.

Each page in the project has it's own model and each model is associated with a view and 
controller.
